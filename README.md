# SoloBrio

Welcome to the GitHub for SoloBrio, SoloBrio acts as a tool which enables musicians to create custom visualizations of their Music. Artists can open a workspace allowing them to drag and drop elements such as shapes, images and text which react to the beat of the song they have uploaded. Users are given total creative freedom to edit the background, foreground and all portions of their visualizer.

If anyone finds this project in the aether of github, please note that I am just beginning coding this project and I am not very experienced. This project is a method of practicing the key skills necessary for the career I aspire to enter which is front-end development.

Note: The developers of SoloBrio are not responsible for what music you upload to the application. If you are not the rightful owner of the music you upload and use inside the application, we(the devs of SoloBrio) are not liable for that. We do not provide the platform to distribute content, instead the application only allows a user to create a piece of media. It is then their choice to distribute the content which makes them legally responsible for distributing the content to which they were not the rightful copyright owners.
